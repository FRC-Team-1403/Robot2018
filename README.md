Java Command-Based

## Java naming system:
- Each command is named with two lowercase letters at the beginning
- These two letters indicate which subsystem or group said command modifies

- The `mpManipulate.java` command modifies the `Manipulation.java` subsystem
- The `cgRightSwitchAuto.java` is a command group (cg)
